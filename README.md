# Reversing Elements of a 2D Array in C++
## Overview
This C++ program initializes a 10x10 2D array with predefined values and then reverses all its elements in-place. It achieves this by swapping corresponding elements from opposite ends of the array using a single loop. Finally, the program prints the reversed 2D array.

## Features
- Uses row-major order to reverse the array
- Efficient in-place swapping
- Demonstrates 2D array indexing & manipulation
- Simple, clean, and beginner-friendly code

## Code Explanation
1. Initializes a 10x10 2D array with sample values.
2. Uses nested loops to traverse the matrix.
3. Swaps elements to reverse their order in-place.
4. Prints the reversed matrix.
