# Reversing-Elements-of-a-2D-Array-in-C-
This C++ program reverses the elements of a 10x10 2D array in-place. It swaps elements symmetrically from the start and end of the array using index calculations, ensuring an efficient reversal process. The updated array is then displayed in a structured format.
